Nest.js is a modern, scalable, and powerful framework for building server-side applications with Node.js. It makes use of several design patterns to help you build maintainable and scalable applications. Some of the most commonly used design patterns in Nest.js include:

1. Dependency Injection: Nest.js makes extensive use of Dependency Injection to manage dependencies in your application. This pattern makes it easy to write modular and testable code.

2. Decorator Pattern: Decorators are used in Nest.js for defining controllers, services, modules, and more. Decorators allow you to add metadata to your code, which Nest.js uses to wire up your application.

3. Factory Pattern: Nest.js makes use of the Factory pattern to create instances of classes. This pattern is used extensively in the module system of Nest.js.

4. Builder Pattern: The Builder pattern is used in Nest.js to create complex objects step by step. This pattern is useful when you need to create an object that requires multiple steps or configurations.

5. Proxy Pattern: The Proxy pattern is used in Nest.js to create proxies for your classes. This pattern is useful for adding additional functionality to your classes without modifying their code directly.

6. Middleware Pattern: The Middleware pattern is used in Nest.js to handle requests and responses. It allows you to add functionality to the request/response pipeline of your application.

7. Strategy Pattern: The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable at runtime. It is useful when you need to implement different variations of an algorithm and want to choose which variation to use at runtime.
    In the context of Nest.js, you might use the Strategy Pattern to implement different algorithms for a particular task, such as payment processing. For example, you might have different payment methods available such as credit card, PayPal, or Stripe, each with their own unique algorithms for processing payments.
    To implement the Strategy Pattern in Nest.js, you would typically define an interface or abstract class that defines the contract for the algorithms, and then implement concrete classes that implement that interface or extend that abstract class. You would then define a context class that uses the interface or abstract class to delegate to the concrete classes at runtime.

These patterns are used extensively in Nest.js and are the building blocks of most Nest.js applications. They help to make the code modular, maintainable, and scalable.
