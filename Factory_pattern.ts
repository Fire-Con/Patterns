typescript
// Define an interface for the product
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

// Define a factory interface
interface ProductFactory {
  createProduct(name: string, price: number): Product;
}

// Define a concrete implementation of the ProductFactory interface
class ConcreteProductFactory implements ProductFactory {
  createProduct(name: string, price: number): Product {
    return { name, price };
  }
}

// Define a provider for the product factory
const productFactoryProvider = {
  provide: 'ProductFactory',
  useClass: ConcreteProductFactory,
};

// Define a service that uses the product factory
@Injectable()
class ProductService {
  constructor(@Inject('ProductFactory') private readonly productFactory: ProductFactory) {}

  createProduct(name: string, price: number): Product {
    return this.productFactory.createProduct(name, price);
  }
}
// In this example, we define an interface for the product and a factory interface for creating products. We then implement the factory interface with a concrete class, 
// ConcreteProductFactory, which creates products with a given name and price.
// We then define a provider for the product factory, which tells Nest.js to use the ConcreteProductFactorywhen the ProductFactorytoken is injected.
// Finally, we define a ProductServicethat uses the ProductFactory to create products. The 
// ProductService is injected with the ProductFactory using the @Inject decorator.
// This is just a simple example, but it demonstrates how you can use the factory pattern in Nest.js to create objects with a single interface, while allowing for different implementations of the factory.
